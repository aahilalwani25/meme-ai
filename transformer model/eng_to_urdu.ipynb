      "to discuss a movie with you\n",
      "try to gather info and decide if i want to watch it at the end\n",
      "which movie?\n",
      "well i watched the social movie about 5 years ago for the first time and highly enjoyed it. \n",
      "which ever movie you were tasked with to talk to me about - in this case the social network\n",
      "in particular eisenbergs portrayal of zuckerberg was highly compelling\n",
      "and its funny as well\n",
      "eisenberg is the lead actor?\n",
      "and if you did not attend an ivy league university, it gives you a sneak peak of what life inside one may be like\n",
      "yes he is the lead actor\n",
      "do you know which other movies he was in?\n",
      "im not sure actually\n",
      "this is the only one of his that i know at all\n",
      "i hope hes not being typecast as zuckerberg\n",
      "because he is a majorly talented actor\n",
      "what other actors were there?\n",
      "justin timberlake and armie hammer were also in it!\n",
      "timberlake was cool\n",
      "he played the founder of napster\n",
      "and which was your favorite character?\n",
      "probably eisenberg as zuckerberg\n",
      "wasn\n",
      "wasnt the most likable character (that was probably saverin) but he played the role incredbily well\n",
      "a nuanced portrait\n",
      "so the film is entirely biographical?\n",
      "yes\n",
      "although i know that zuckerberg has complained about the accuracy of the plot\n",
      "theres quite a bit of tension in it\n",
      "does it feature the \"evil twins\"? (i forgot their names)\n",
      "yes!\n",
      "the winklevoss twins!\n",
      "although they dont sound/appear that evil in the film\n",
      "they look cheated actually \n",
      "whats your favorite scene?\n",
      "probably the deposition of zuckerberg\n",
      "when hes being investigated for fraudulently claiming he came up with the idea for facebook\n",
      "how about the soundtrack? anything worth noting?\n",
      "jaws was such a good movie!\n",
      "i agree. it was well made.\n",
      "the scares were well timed.\n",
      "i liked the soundtrack.\n",
      "what was your favorite part?\n",
      "i think it was utilizing a location like amity island. it made me feel as if the plot could happen anywhere.\n",
      "was the soundtrack your favorite part?\n",
      "that makes sense. yes, especially the part that it is so famous for. the sound they played whenever they wanted to increase the audiences fear and anxiety.\n",
      "just another affirmation that spielberg knew what he was doing even in post-production.\n",
      "do you usually like this type of movie?\n",
      "no doubt. he is very good at making movies. no, it is not my favorite kind. i am not much into jump scares. i like documentaries. how about you?\n",
      "that is understandable. halloween is a good time to scare yourself. \n",
      "what did you think of the mayors reaction to the shark attack?\n",
      "i think it was greedy. i agree it is best not to panic the public, but putting people in danger out of greed is not okay.\n",
      "exactly, i thought it was neat to think of real world implications both fiscally and morally.\n",
      "of how to present this to the public.\n",
      "which in the end resulted in a shark-hunting frenzy\n",
      "you are right on that.\n",
      "it was nice to see characters such as brody step up - though it took his son to go into shock in order to spur him to action.\n",
      "i think spielberg hit the nail on the head as far as portraying small town politics.\n",
      "yes. it was realistic, though i think much of it applies to politics of all types. \n",
      "money seems to always be highest priority.\n",
      "unfortunately, true.\n",
      "and sadly we do not get galvanized to action sometimes until tragedy strikes.\n",
      "have you seen other spielberg movies?\n",
      "yes, he has his shining moments and some duds along the way. i feel that more of his movies fall into the former rather than latter category.\n",
      "you?\n",
      "i know i have and that his movies are usually really well made, but i cannot remember which movies are his. i am very bad at stuff like that.\n",
      "i did not like the scuba part. i enjoy enjoy breathing.\n",
      " i usually am as well.\n",
      "sorry, for the typo.\n",
      "no worries. completely agree on breathing/ i would not be getting in the water even with a cage.\n",
      "well, thanks for sharing this conversation with me. it seems that our time has come to an end. i hope you have a wonderful morning, afternoon, night wherever you are.\n",
      "you as well.\n",
      "hi! today well be discussing batman vs superman!\n",
      "great! do i need to watch any other dc comic movies prior to watching this one?\n",
      "i cant honestly say, however, as a critic noted \"its better than man of steel but not as good as the dark knight\". \n",
      "who are the lead actors? \n",
      "it follows 2013s man of steel so you would probably need to see it just to be safe...\n",
      "batman, superman and even wonder woman makes an appearance!\n",
      "haha! do you know which actors play batman, superman, and wonder woman in this movie? \n",
      "all but ben affleck. lest super hero movie i saw him in was daredevil and that was rough. lets hope hes better in this. \n",
      "though, i am a michael keaton fan when it comes to batman. i suspect anyone playing batman who is not keaton will be weird to me. \n",
      "most of the critics wasnt too fond of it, but cinemascore have it a rating of b, which i feel is about right for this film!\n",
      "have you seen it?\n",
      "i have and would grade it a solid b, just as cinemascore did. are you a fan of director zack snyder?\n",
      "im not sure. what other movies has he directed? \n",
      "has he directed anything else besides the batman or superman movies?\n",
      "i cant honestly say. i know he directed this film while david s. goyer and chris terrio cowrote it. \n",
      "batman and superman are enemies in this film? \n",
      "they are - lex luthor, who is obsessed with defeating superman, basically manipulates them into fighting each other.\n",
      "whose side is wonder woman on?\n",
      "do the join forces after that?\n",
      "they do thankfully - batman actually saves martha while superman travels to the scout ship to confront luther.\n",
      "does he kill luther? \n",
      "so basically leaving an opening for another movie in the franchise?\n",
      "while it did seem like 153 minutes of a grown man whacking two dolls together, i still found it better than man of steel.\n",
      "wait, superman dies? how??\n",
      "hi\n",
      "hello!\n",
      "how are u ?\n",
      "good, you?\n",
      "im ok \n",

      "i havent either, but i love the story of sleeping beauty\n",
      "me too\n",
      "iy has 51 in rotten tomatoes\n",
      "so hmm\n",
      "not that good\n",
      "5.7 out of 10. yikes\n",
      "i know\n",
      "so this movie is more about the villan\n",
      "is a dark fantasy film\n",
      "yes\n",
      "wow\n",
      "so she was originally a fairy\n",
      "yes\n",
      "i cant believe its been so long since this movie came out\n",
      "she fells in love with a human it says\n",
      "i know\n",
      "right\n",
      "and then her wings are cut off\n",
      "i think i only heard about this movie once\n",
      "oh wow\n",
      "ah man phillips kiss doesnt work\n",
      "and her lover betrayed her\n",
      "stefan is auroras father\n",

      "yea\n",
      "i feel bad for her now\n",
      "oh boy\n",
      "she sends stefan to his death\n",
      "yeah i feel bad too\n",
      "i know its different, but i like the old fashioned sleeping beauty too much\n",
      "i dont like how they changed it around\n",
      "yea\n",
      "they changed it for it to only get a 5.1 rating\n",
      "this film wanted to break the stereotype\n",
      "but it was too much\n",
      "righy\n",
      "right\n",
      "they fixed it when it wasnt broken\n",
      "yea\n",
      "it was too much\n",
      "and i havent heard about that director\n",
      "i wonder if this is the first movie he made\n",
      "he actually sounds familiar\n",
      "it probably takes a lot to direct a movie like this\n",
      "i think u are right\n",
      "but its metacritic score was 56/100. ow\n",
      "really low\n",
      "from what i hear angelina jolie performed really well in it\n",
      "well i love her\n",
      "im a girl\n",
      "not like that\n",
      "lol\n",
      "haha\n",
      "she is a good actress\n",
      "i think she is a great person and actres\n",
      "there is a scene where aurora is a little girl and she goes up to maleficent\n",
      "and they had to use angelinas daughter\n",
      "oh really ???\n",
      "because her daughter was the only one who wouldnt get scared and run away lol\n",
      "so i like that\n",
      "yea\n",
      "but the critical responses\n",
      "it is interesting that, like frozen, a prince was not needed for the true love scenario\n",
      "it was like a mother daughter love\n",
      "and i love that\n",
      "which i really like\n",
      "i hate that u need a prince all the time\n",
      "to make \" everything better \"\n",
      "me too\n",
      "it seems like a very entertaining movie\n",
      "and i will have to watch it\n",
      "i might give it a chance this weekend \n",
      "me too\n",
      "but i dont my 2 year old would stand still\n",
      "what is your opinion on the movie jaws? \n",
      "to be honest, i find shark movies to be terrifying.\n",
      "i cant say i blame you. the movie definitely makes that fear worse! \n",
      "did you know that this film was based on a book?\n",
      "no, i didnt. not surprised though. most movies tend to be. \n",
      "i do love the jaws music though. \n",
      "agreed, it heightens the tension and makes it scarier, but thats kind of the point.\n",
      "are you surprised at how high the rating is for the films critic score? and if i heard the music while driving, i would think someone was coming to take me out. haha\n",
      "97% is incredibly high, i would have thought that there would be at least some people throwing low scores in there somewhere.\n",
      "do you agree that its a \"cheerfully perverse\" scare movie?\n",
      "do you think that it \"is too gruesome for children\"? \n",
      "for small children, yes. i could see them having nightmares.\n",
      "i definitely agree with that. i do find it odd that it is considered a \"thriller\" film. \n",
      "agreed, there typically arent many shark attacks in new england, usually further south or on the west coast.\n",
      "i cant imagine i would keep going to the beach as a tourist if lots of people kept turning up dead.\n",
      "or you would think that tourists would join in on the bounty to make the money. \n",
      "i wasnt aware that there were so many different types of sharks so near to the shore. \n",
      "the key scens describes both a tiger shark and a great white.\n",
      "i wonder if the mayor is paid off somewhere in the town or gets a cut of the beaches being open? hes far to adamant about keeping them open. and i always thought tiger sharks were smaller. \n",
      "i always think of great whites as the huge \"jaws\" sharks. \n",
      "it seems odd that they dont ask a scientist or marine biologist at some point to intervene.\n",
